To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

Install the eSpeak library on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng

Open a text editor and paste the code into a new file. Save the file with a ".c" extension, for example, "text_to_speech.c".

Compile the code using the "gcc" command, including the necessary eSpeak library flags. Run the following command in the terminal:

gcc text_to_speech.c -o text_to_speech -lespeak-ng


This command will generate an executable file named "text_to_speech" that includes the eSpeak library.

Run the program by executing the generated executable file. Enter the desired text, and the program will speak it out loud.

Note: Make sure you have installed the eSpeak library and have the necessary development packages installed on your system. The library usage and installation process might vary depending on your operating system.
