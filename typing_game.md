To play the game:

Open a text editor and copy the above code into a new file.
Save the file with a .c extension, for example, typing_game.c.
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the C file is saved.
Compile the C file using a C compiler. For example, if you have GCC installed, you can compile the program with the command:


gcc typing_game.c -o typing_game


This will generate an executable file named typing_game (or a different name if you specified one).
Run the game using the command

./typing_game


The game will start and present you with a random word. Type the word within the time limit specified (5 seconds by default). If you type the word correctly within the time limit, you earn 1 point and proceed to the next round. If you make a mistake or exceed the time limit, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
Note: This is a basic example of a typing game. You can further enhance the game by adding features like a scoring system, difficulty levels, different word lengths, high scores, and graphical user interface (GUI) elements.
