This code uses the conio.h library for keyboard input and the stdlib.h library for system commands. The snake is represented by the letter 'O', and the food is represented by the letter 'S'. The snake can be controlled using the 'a', 'd', 'w', and 's' keys for left, right, up, and down directions, respectively. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself, and the score is displayed at the end.

Please note that this is a basic implementation, and it may not include advanced features such as collision detection, game over screen, or smooth animation. Feel free to modify and enhance the code as per your requirements.

Compile the code using the "gcc" command. Run the following command in the command prompt:

gcc snake_game.c -o snake_game

This command will generate an executable file named "snake_game.exe" (or "snake_game" on Linux/macOS).

Run the program by executing the generated executable file. Enter the following command:


snake_game


The snake game will start running, and you can play it using the keyboard controls.

Note: Please make sure you have a C compiler installed (such as GCC) and properly configured on your system before attempting to compile and run the code.
