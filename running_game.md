In this example, the player is represented by the letter 'R', and the obstacle is represented by the letter 'X'. The player can move up using the 'w' key and down using the 's' key. The game ends when the player collides with the obstacle, and the score is displayed at the end.

To compile and run the program, follow the same steps mentioned earlier for compiling and running a C program.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may not include advanced features such as collision detection, game over screen, or smooth animation. Feel free to modify and enhance the code to suit your needs.

Compile the code using the "gcc" command. Run the following command in the command prompt:

gcc running_game.c -o running_game


Run the program by executing the generated executable file. Enter the following command:

running_game

The running game will start running, and you can play it using the 'w' and 's' keys to move the player up and down, respectively. Press 'x' to exit the game.

Note: Please make sure you have a C compiler installed (such as GCC) and properly configured on your system before attempting to compile and run the code. Additionally, the code uses the windows.h header file, which may be specific to Windows systems. If you are running this code on a non-Windows system, you may need to modify the code or find an alternative library for handling keyboard input and delay.
