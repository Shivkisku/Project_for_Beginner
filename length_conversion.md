This program allows the user to input a length in centimeters and converts it to meters, inches, feet, and millimeters. The conversion functions (cmToMeter, cmToInch, inchToFeet, and kmToMillimeter) are used to perform the respective conversions.

Compile the C file using a C compiler. For example, if you have GCC installed, you can compile the program with the command

gcc length_conversion.c -o length_conversion


This will generate an executable file named length_conversion (or a different name if you specified one).
Run the program using the command

./length_conversion


The program will prompt you to enter a length in centimeters. Provide the input and press Enter.
The program will perform the conversions and display the length in meters, inches, feet, and millimeters on the console.
